# HumanEval 114: `minSubArraySum`

Kadane's algorithm for the minimum subarray sum, verified against the spec of
`leanprover/human-eval-lean`.

`afrom s l` is the functional core of the loop: the minimum over `0` and all sums of
subarrays of `l` that are nonempty or extend the carried suffix sum `s`. The loop
invariant is a single equation, `min minSum (afrom s cur.suffix) = afrom 0 xs.toList`,
and its preservation is one `afrom_cons` unfolding, discharged by `finish`.

The pure theory characterizes `afrom` by structural induction in the cons direction,
where `take`/`drop` reduce by one equation per step: bounds (`afrom_le_carry`,
`afrom_le_sub`), attainment (`afrom_mem`), and the packaging
`isMinSubarraySum₀_afrom`. The endgame lemmas that split on the sign of the loop
result are ported from the upstream file.

Upstream (`HumanEvalLean/HumanEval114.lean`) proves the invariant preservation in the
append direction, through `IsMinSuffixSum₀` and two `@[grind =>]` preservation lemmas
for `xs ++ [x]` of about seventy-five lines.

/-! The same theorem without `vcgen`. The loop has no early return, so the aux lemma
is a single equation: starting from accumulators `(ms, s)`, the loop computes
`min ms (afrom s l)`. The `afrom` theory and the endgame lemmas are shared with the
`vcgen` proof; everything added below is the loop reflection and the plumbing to
reach it.

Places to get stuck, each absent from the `vcgen` proof:

1. The reflection equation must be found and generalized over both accumulators; the
   `vcgen` invariant `min minSum (afrom s cur.suffix) = afrom 0 xs.toList` states the
   same fact against the cursor and gets the generalization from the loop rule.
2. The program iterates over an `Array` while the induction wants a list: the
   `Array.forIn_toList` bridge has to be applied inside the statement of the key
   fact, where the `forIn` is not yet under binders, because `rw` cannot reach the
   occurrence in the goal (the accumulators' `have` bindings put it under a binder).
3. One defeq transport (`have key' : … := key`) moves the loop equation onto the
   goal's `have`-normalized lambda, for the same elaboration-identity reason as in
   the other examples. -/
