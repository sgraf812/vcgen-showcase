# Integer square root by linear search

A `while` loop in `Id`. The proof supplies the loop invariant (`inv1`, split into the
looping state `.inl` and the exit state `.inr`) and the termination variant (`inv2`).
`finish` discharges the verification conditions, including the nonlinear arithmetic.

`while` loops elaborate to the `repeatM` least fixpoint. `Manual.isqrt_correct` proves
the same theorem by unfolding that fixpoint step by step under an explicit fuel
induction.

/-! The same theorem without `vcgen`, against the `repeatM` fixpoint that `while`
elaborates to (via `Lean.Loop.forIn`). The loop body is abstracted as `F` together
with its two reduction equations, and the induction is on explicit fuel `n - r`,
unfolding the fixpoint once per step with `repeatM_eq_of_monadTail`.

Places to get stuck, each absent from the `vcgen` proof:

1. Finding the unfolding lemma at all: `repeatM` is opaque; its one sanctioned
   unfolding `repeatM_eq_of_monadTail` lives in `Init.Internal.Order.While` behind a
   `MonadTail` instance, and nothing in the goal points there.
2. The variant must become explicit fuel, with the invariant `r * r ≤ n` and the
   fuel bound `n - r ≤ fuel` threaded through every case; `vcgen` takes the variant
   as the `inv2` clause and hides the induction.
3. Matcher identity: the aux lemma cannot be stated against a hand-written copy of
   the loop body, because the copy elaborates its `match` to a different auxiliary
   matcher than the one inside `isqrt`; `rw`, `show` and even `exact`-unification
   fail across the two. Abstracting the body as `F` with equation hypotheses and
   discharging them at the use site (where `rfl` sees the right matcher) is the way
   out.
4. `match (pure x : Id _) with …` does not iota-reduce syntactically and the entire
   `Id` simp set is keyed on `.run`, so the body equations must produce `pure`-free
   right-hand sides before any reduction happens.
